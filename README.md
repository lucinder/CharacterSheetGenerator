# Character Sheet Generator
### Prototype for a D&amp;D 5e random character sheet generator.
*Right now this is in early WIP stages. Please be patient as more and more features are added!*

Note: This generator uses the Revised Ranger features from its UA release in place of the original Ranger features.

Racial ASIs (Ability Score Improvements) are allocated by the generator, but no class-based ASIs are allocated. This is done in order to allow the player to select feats in place of ASIs if they so desire, or allow non-algorithmic stat allocation.
